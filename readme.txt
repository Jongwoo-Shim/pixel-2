A website designed to emulate r/place from April 1, 2017, on a smaller scale, a 150 x 150 pixel board with a 1 pixel/min/user limit,  instead of the original 1000 x 1000 pixel board with a 5 pixel/min/user limit.
In addition to the original concept, we've designed a sandbox mode for users and a chat room function in order to coordinate drawings by groups.

Tech Used:
HTML5/CSS/JS/Python
